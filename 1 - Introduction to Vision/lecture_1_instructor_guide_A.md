# Lecture 1: Instructor Guide A - Structured Technical Approach
## Neural Network Fundamentals + MNIST

---

## Pre-Class Preparation (30 minutes before)

### Technical Setup Checklist
- [ ] **Environment**: Test PyTorch installation on classroom computers
- [ ] **Dataset**: Pre-download MNIST to avoid network delays  
- [ ] **Slides**: Load slides and test all code snippets
- [ ] **Backup Plan**: Have offline materials ready
- [ ] **Hardware**: Verify GPU availability (if applicable)

### Student Prerequisites Verification
```python
# Quick check script to run at start of class
import torch
import torchvision
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print(f"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}")
print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
print("Environment ready!")
```

## Lesson Structure & Timing

### Opening (10 minutes)
**Objective**: Hook students with the power of neural networks

**Script**: 
> "Today you'll build a system that can read handwritten numbers better than most humans. By the end of class, your computer will recognize digits with 95%+ accuracy."

**Demo**: Show a quick MNIST prediction on a pre-trained model
- Load a digit image
- Show prediction confidence scores
- Emphasize: "You'll build this from scratch today"

---

### Section 1: Mathematical Foundations (15 minutes)

**Key Concepts to Emphasize**:
1. **Weighted sum**: Core operation in every neuron
2. **Activation functions**: Why we need non-linearity  
3. **Matrix operations**: How layers connect

**Teaching Strategy**:
- Start with single neuron math
- Build up to multiple neurons
- Show matrix form for efficiency

**Common Student Questions**:
- *"Why do we need bias terms?"* 
  - **Answer**: Bias allows the activation function to shift, increasing model flexibility
- *"Why ReLU instead of sigmoid?"*
  - **Answer**: ReLU prevents vanishing gradient problem and is computationally efficient

**Interactive Element**:
```python
# Have students calculate this by hand first
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
w = torch.tensor([0.5, -0.5, 0.2])
b = 0.1
output = torch.sum(x * w) + b
print(f"Manual calculation: {output}")
```

### Section 2: PyTorch Fundamentals (20 minutes)

**Learning Objectives**:
- Understand tensors vs arrays
- Master autograd for automatic differentiation  
- Create simple computational graphs

**Demonstration Sequence**:
1. **Tensor basics** (5 min)
2. **Autograd magic** (10 min)
3. **Simple gradient computation** (5 min)

**Live Coding - Start Simple**:
```python
# Progression: Start here and build complexity
x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = x ** 2
y.backward()
print(f"dy/dx at x=2: {x.grad}")  # Should be 4
```

**Potential Pitfalls**:
- Students forget `requires_grad=True`
- Multiple `.backward()` calls without `zero_grad()`
- Mixing tensor types (float vs int)

**Troubleshooting Tips**:
- Always check tensor shapes with `.shape`
- Use `.item()` to extract scalar values
- Show gradients visually when possible

---

### Section 3: MNIST Data Analysis (15 minutes)

**Objectives**:
- Understand dataset structure
- Learn preprocessing importance
- Visualize data distribution

**Interactive Data Exploration**:
```python
# Have students run this and discuss results
train_dataset = datasets.MNIST('data', train=True, download=True)
print(f"Dataset size: {len(train_dataset)}")
print(f"Image shape: {train_dataset[0][0].size}")
print(f"Label: {train_dataset[0][1]}")

# Visualize class distribution
labels = [train_dataset[i][1] for i in range(1000)]
plt.hist(labels, bins=10)
plt.title("Class Distribution")
plt.show()
```

**Discussion Points**:
- Why is normalization important?
- How does batch size affect training?
- What preprocessing steps are needed?

---

### Section 4: Model Architecture (25 minutes)

**Teaching Strategy**: Build the model incrementally

**Step 1: Single Layer** (8 minutes)
```python
# Start with this - students can understand immediately
simple_layer = nn.Linear(784, 10)
```

**Step 2: Add Activation** (7 minutes)
```python
# Show why we need activation functions
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Flatten(),
    nn.Linear(784, 10)
)
# Discuss: What's wrong with this?
```

**Step 3: Complete Architecture** (10 minutes)
```python
# Final architecture
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Flatten(),
    nn.Linear(784, 128),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(128, 64),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(64, 10)
)
```

**Architecture Design Discussion**:
- Why these specific layer sizes?
- How to choose number of hidden layers?
- When to use different activation functions?

### Section 5: Training Implementation (35 minutes)

**Teaching Philosophy**: Build understanding through debugging

**Phase 1: Setup Components** (10 minutes)
```python
# Have students implement each component
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
```

**Phase 2: Basic Training Loop** (15 minutes)
```python
# Start with single batch to debug
for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
    if batch_idx > 0: break  # Only first batch
    
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = criterion(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    print(f"Batch {batch_idx}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

**Phase 3: Full Training Loop** (10 minutes)
- Remove the break condition
- Add progress tracking
- Implement evaluation

**Common Student Errors**:
1. Forgetting `optimizer.zero_grad()`
2. Not setting `model.train()` and `model.eval()`
3. Calculating accuracy incorrectly

**Debugging Checklist for Students**:
- [ ] Loss is decreasing over epochs?
- [ ] Gradients are being computed? (check `param.grad`)
- [ ] Model architecture matches expected input/output sizes?
- [ ] Data is properly normalized?

---

### Section 6: Evaluation & Analysis (20 minutes)

**Evaluation Implementation**:
```python
def evaluate_model(model, test_loader):
    model.eval()
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data, target in test_loader:
            outputs = model(data)
            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
            total += target.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == target).sum().item()
    
    accuracy = 100 * correct / total
    print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}%')
    return accuracy
```

**Analysis Discussion Points**:
- What accuracy did students achieve?
- Which digits are hardest to classify?
- How does training time affect performance?

**Visualization Activity**:
```python
# Show misclassified examples
def show_misclassified(model, test_loader, num_examples=5):
    # Implementation for students to complete
    pass
```

## Assessment & Feedback

### Real-time Assessment Questions

**During Math Section**:
> "What happens to the output if we remove the bias term?"

**During Implementation**:
> "Why do we call `optimizer.zero_grad()` in each iteration?"

**During Training**:
> "What does it mean if loss stops decreasing?"

### Expected Student Outcomes
- **Beginner students**: Achieve 80-90% accuracy
- **Intermediate students**: Achieve 95%+ accuracy with understanding
- **Advanced students**: Experiment with hyperparameters and analyze results

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Technical Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
