## Problem Briefing: The ZIP Code Challenge (20 minutes)

### Real-World Context Setting

**Scenario Setup**:
> "You're a data scientist at the US Postal Service. Mail sorting facilities process 500 million pieces of mail daily. Currently, human operators read ZIP codes on envelopes, but this is expensive and slow. Your task: build an automated system to read handwritten ZIP codes."

**Stakeholder Requirements**:
- **Accuracy**: >95% (errors mean misdelivered mail)
- **Speed**: <100ms per image (postal processing speed)
- **Cost**: Must be cheaper than human operators
- **Reliability**: Must work on various handwriting styles

### Problem Analysis Workshop

**Group Activity (10 minutes)**:
Divide class into "project teams" of 4-5 students. Each team analyzes:
1. **Technical challenges**: What makes handwriting recognition hard?
2. **Data requirements**: What kind of training data do we need?
3. **Success metrics**: How do we measure if our solution works?
4. **Constraints**: What limitations do we need to consider?

**Team Presentations (5 minutes each)**:
Each team presents their analysis. Instructor synthesizes common insights.

**Key Insights to Draw Out**:
- Handwriting varies dramatically between people
- Need large amounts of labeled training data
- Speed vs accuracy trade-offs
- Need robust evaluation methodology

### Requirements Document Creation

**Collaborative Documentation**:
Based on team presentations, create a shared requirements document:

```markdown
# ZIP Code Recognition System Requirements

## Functional Requirements
- Input: 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits
- Output: Predicted digit class (0-9) with confidence score
- Accuracy: >95% on test data
- Inference time: <100ms per image

## Non-Functional Requirements  
- Maintainable code with clear documentation
- Reproducible training process
- Scalable to handle varying loads
- Robust error handling

## Success Criteria
- Beat baseline accuracy of 85%
- Demonstrate generalization to new handwriting styles
- Complete implementation within class session
```

## Problem-Solving Phase 1: Data Analysis (25 minutes)

### Challenge: Understanding the Problem Space

**Investigative Questions**:
Present students with MNIST data but frame as detective work:
- "What patterns exist in this data?"  
- "What makes some samples harder to classify?"
- "How representative is our training data?"

### Guided Data Exploration

**Investigation 1: Sample Analysis**
```python
# Have students work through this systematically
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Question: "Before looking at the data, what do you expect to find?"
dataset = datasets.MNIST('data', train=True, download=True)

# Discovery task: "Explore this dataset and present 3 key findings"
# Give teams 15 minutes to investigate
```

**Expected Student Discoveries**:
- Class distribution (roughly balanced)
- Significant variation within classes
- Some samples are ambiguous even to humans
- Image quality varies

**Problem-Solving Discussion**:
- "Based on your analysis, what preprocessing steps do we need?"
- "What makes this problem challenging for a computer?"
- "How should we split data for training/testing?"

### Data Preprocessing Strategy Session

**Challenge**: "Design a preprocessing pipeline"

**Team Brainstorming**:
Each team proposes preprocessing steps with justification:
1. **Normalization**: Why and how?
2. **Data augmentation**: What variations to include?
3. **Quality filtering**: Should we remove bad samples?

**Implementation Workshop**:
```python
# Teams implement their proposed preprocessing
def preprocess_data(raw_data):
    # Student teams implement their strategies
    # Compare results across different approaches
    pass

# A/B test different preprocessing approaches
results = {}
for team, preprocess_fn in team_approaches.items():
    processed_data = preprocess_fn(raw_data)
    # Quick baseline model to test preprocessing impact
    baseline_acc = quick_baseline_test(processed_data)
    results[team] = baseline_acc
```

## Problem-Solving Phase 2: Architecture Design (30 minutes)

### Challenge: Design for Requirements

**Engineering Constraints**:
- Must process 28Ã—28 images
- Need 10 output classes
- Speed requirement: <100ms inference
- Accuracy requirement: >95%

### Architecture Design Sprint

**Design Thinking Process** (15 minutes):

**Step 1: Ideation**
- Individual brainstorming (5 minutes)
- "How would you recognize digits if you were a computer?"
- Sketch ideas on paper first

**Step 2: Collaboration**
- Team discussion and synthesis (10 minutes)
- Combine individual ideas into team proposal
- Consider trade-offs: complexity vs performance vs speed

**Design Presentations** (10 minutes):
Each team presents architecture with justification:
- Why these layer sizes?
- Why these activation functions?
- How does this meet our requirements?

**Instructor Synthesis**:
Compare proposed architectures and identify common patterns.

### Prototype Implementation

**Rapid Prototyping Challenge**:
```python
# Each team implements their architecture
class TeamArchitecture(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Teams implement their designs
        pass
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Teams implement forward pass
        pass

# Quick parameter count analysis
def analyze_architecture(model):
    total_params = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())
    print(f"Total parameters: {total_params:,}")
    
    # Estimate inference time (rule of thumb)
    estimated_time = total_params / 1_000_000 * 10  # rough ms estimate
    print(f"Estimated inference time: {estimated_time:.1f}ms")
    
    return total_params < 1_000_000  # Meets speed requirement?
```

**Design Review Session**:
- Teams present parameter counts and speed estimates
- Identify architectures that meet requirements
- Discuss trade-offs between different approaches

## Problem-Solving Phase 3: Training Strategy (35 minutes)

### Challenge: Optimize Learning Process

**Training Strategy Workshop**:

**Problem Statement**: 
"Your model needs to learn from 60,000 examples efficiently. Design a training strategy that maximizes performance while minimizing training time."

### Experimental Design Approach

**Hypothesis Formation**:
Teams form hypotheses about training parameters:
- "We hypothesize that learning rate X will work best because..."
- "We predict batch size Y will be optimal because..."
- "We expect optimizer Z will perform best because..."

**Controlled Experiments**:
```python
# Each team tests one variable systematically
experiment_configs = {
    'team1': {'lr': 0.01, 'batch_size': 64, 'optimizer': 'SGD'},
    'team2': {'lr': 0.001, 'batch_size': 64, 'optimizer': 'SGD'},  
    'team3': {'lr': 0.01, 'batch_size': 128, 'optimizer': 'SGD'},
    'team4': {'lr': 0.01, 'batch_size': 64, 'optimizer': 'Adam'},
}

# Each team runs their experiment
def run_experiment(config):
    model = create_model()
    optimizer = get_optimizer(model, config)
    
    # Training loop with progress tracking
    results = train_model(model, optimizer, config)
    return results

# Compare results across teams
```

### Live Training Competition

**Setup**: All teams train simultaneously with their chosen strategies
**Tracking**: Real-time leaderboard on shared screen
**Metrics**: Track both training speed and final accuracy

```python
# Live dashboard update function
def update_leaderboard(team_results):
    print("\n" + "="*50)
    print("LIVE LEADERBOARD")
    print("="*50)
    
    sorted_teams = sorted(team_results.items(), 
                         key=lambda x: x[1]['accuracy'], 
                         reverse=True)
    
    for rank, (team, results) in enumerate(sorted_teams, 1):
        print(f"{rank}. {team}: {results['accuracy']:.2f}% "
              f"(Training time: {results['time']:.1f}s)")
```

**Problem-Solving Discussions During Training**:
- "Why might some teams be training faster?"
- "What does it mean when loss stops decreasing?"
- "How do we know when to stop training?"

### Debugging Workshop

**Common Problems Simulation**:
Introduce intentional bugs for teams to solve:
```python
# Bug 1: Forgot to normalize data
# Bug 2: Learning rate too high
# Bug 3: Wrong loss function
# Bug 4: Data leakage in validation

# Teams work together to diagnose and fix issues
```

**Debugging Strategies**:
1. **Systematic checking**: Data, model, training loop
2. **Ablation studies**: Remove components to isolate issues
3. **Visualization**: Plot losses, gradients, predictions
4. **Baseline comparison**: Compare against known good implementation

---

## Problem-Solving Phase 4: Evaluation & Validation (20 minutes)

### Challenge: Prove Your Solution Works

**Evaluation Framework Design**:

**Question**: "How do we convince the postal service that our solution is ready for deployment?"

**Evaluation Strategy Workshop**:
Teams design comprehensive evaluation:
1. **Accuracy metrics**: Overall and per-class performance
2. **Speed benchmarks**: Inference time measurement
3. **Robustness testing**: Edge cases and error analysis
4. **Comparison studies**: Against baselines and competition

### Real-World Testing Simulation

**Implementation**:
```python
def comprehensive_evaluation(model, test_loader):
    """
    Students implement thorough evaluation
    following their designed framework
    """
    
    results = {}
    
    # Accuracy testing
    results['accuracy'] = test_accuracy(model, test_loader)
    
    # Speed benchmarking
    results['speed'] = measure_inference_speed(model)
    
    # Per-class analysis
    results['confusion_matrix'] = compute_confusion_matrix(model, test_loader)
    
    # Edge case testing
    results['difficult_samples'] = find_difficult_cases(model, test_loader)
    
    return results

# Each team presents their evaluation results
```

**Evaluation Presentations**:
Each team presents evaluation findings:
- "Does our model meet the requirements?"
- "What are the main failure modes?"
- "How confident are we in deployment?"

### Business Case Development

**Final Challenge**: "Convince the stakeholders"

**Presentation Structure**:
1. **Problem summary**: What challenge did we solve?
2. **Technical approach**: How does our solution work?
3. **Performance results**: Does it meet requirements?
4. **Business impact**: Cost savings, efficiency gains
5. **Risk assessment**: What could go wrong?
6. **Deployment plan**: Next steps for implementation

**Stakeholder Q&A Simulation**:
Instructor plays skeptical stakeholder:
- "How do I know this will work on real mail?"
- "What happens if the system fails?"
- "How much will this cost to maintain?"
