## Labs and Concepts to cover
1. Model Parameter Counting, Fitting into GPU calculation
2. Model Parameter Growth and training time growth
3. Loss curve problems and debugging
4. Understanding standard pipeline for Neural Networks. Mastering the fundamental
5. Model Parameter Report via torchsummary or torchinfo. Or a simpler implementation of torchsummary but easier report. Just like lightning, model report summary I should reimplement to see sequential and loop models better.

TODO: Create HTML explainer with cursor coding assistant. (Parameter counting and fitting into GPU)
TODO: Model parameter growth


# TODO: Same code without and with accelerate.
# Most Frequent Errors. Do these errors, and move them out of the system
# Master Training Loop, most frequently written
# Device errors and shape error
# Variable name error
